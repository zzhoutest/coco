ssbotbuilder: Bot SDK in Javascript

app: example Bot built with ssbotbuilder

weatherBot-Example: An Example Weather Bot built on ssbotbuilder SDK.

SDK Contains the methods to obtain JWT Token from oAuth Server.

Bot Application has to register for Statelistener with Bot SDK. 
Once Bot Application receives Ready State in StateListener, SDK is in ready State. 
Due to any error response for Token, Bot SDK will post a callback to change state to NotReady State, in that case Bot 
has to wait for ready indication.

If Bot tries to send message to BotPlatform while Bot SDK is not in ready State, Message Sending will be failed.

StateListener example in Bot Application
 var onStateListener = function(state, reason) {
     if(!state) { // When bot-sdk is not ready, bot application has to maintain this state. 
       console.log('Cannot send any message all messages should be buffered now ' + reason);
     } else {
       console.log("Bot is working correctly");
     }
 }
